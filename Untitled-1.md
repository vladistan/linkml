// Song: Purple Stew
// Lyrics:
// (Verse 1)



We are making a purple stew, scoop it up, it's true,
Elisa slipped on a banana, into the pot she flew!
We are making a purple stew, watch it bubble and brew,
Kate chased a giggling grape, right into the stew!

(Chorus)
Stir it up, stir it up, in our funny purple stew,
Watch Mama toss in tickles, and Aiee's sneeze "Achoo!"
Bush hides behind the carrots, peeking just in view,
Bunny with floppy ears, jumps in with a "Boo!"

(Verse 2)
We are making a purple stew, with every friend in sight,
Lizzie rides a spoon like a witch taking flight.
We are making a purple stew, it's a magical night,
Benjamin the brave, armors up with a lid, alright!

(Chorus)
Stir it up, stir it up, in our giggly purple stew,
Zosha spins like a top, swirling through the dew.
Bridget bakes cookies, tossing them from afar,
Into the stew they go, landing with a star.

(Bridge)
We are making a purple stew, from all that we are,
Tossing in our laughs, from near and from far.

(Chorus)
Stir it up, stir it up, in our wacky purple stew,
It’s a circus of flavors, with a clown shoe or two.
As we giggle and wiggle, the stew just grows,
In the pot of our friendship, where silly always flows.

(Outro)
We are making a purple stew, it’s more than just a game,
It’s a parade of our funnies, each one with a name.
As the stars twinkle bright, and we all say "Goodnight!",
Our purple stew keeps bubbling, under the moon’s soft light.
